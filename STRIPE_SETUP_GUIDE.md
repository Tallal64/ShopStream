## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A Stripe account (free to create at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com))
- Node.js and npm installed
- The ShopStream application running locally
- Basic understanding of command line/terminal

## Getting Stripe API Keys

### Step 1: Create a Stripe Account

1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Click "Start now" and create a free account
3. Complete the account setup process

### Step 2: Access Your API Keys

1. Log in to your Stripe Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developers > API keys** in the left sidebar
3. You'll see your API keys:
   - **Publishable key**: Starts with `pk_test_` (safe to use in frontend)
   - **Secret key**: Starts with `sk_test_` (NEVER share this publicly!)

### Step 3: Copy Your Keys

```bash
# Example keys (these are fake - use your real keys)
Publishable key: pk_test_51234567890abcdefghijklmnop
Secret key: sk_test_51234567890abcdefghijklmnop (keep this secret!)
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

### Backend Environment Variables (.env file)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:

```bash
# Copy from .env.sample and fill in your actual values
cp .env.sample .env
```

Update your `.env` file with your Stripe keys:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### Frontend Environment Variables (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
touch .env
```

Update `frontend/.env`:

```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
```

**Important Notes:**

- Never commit `.env` files to Git
- Only use test keys during development
- The publishable key is safe to use in frontend code
- The secret key should ONLY be used in backend code

## Installing Stripe CLI

The Stripe CLI is a tool that lets you test webhooks locally by forwarding Stripe events to your local development server.

### On macOS:

```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

### On Windows:

1. Download from [https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest)
2. Extract the executable and add it to your PATH

### On Linux:

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest/download/stripe_1.19.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz

# Extract it
tar -xvf stripe_1.19.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz

# Move to your PATH
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify Installation:

```bash
stripe --version
```

## Testing Webhooks Locally

### Step 1: Login to Stripe CLI

```bash
stripe login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Stripe account.

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Make sure both your backend and frontend are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Your backend should be running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 3: Forward Webhooks to Your Local Server

Open a third terminal and run:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/v1/webhook/stripe
```

You should see output like:

```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_1234567890abcdef... (^C to quit)
```

### Step 4: Copy the Webhook Secret

Copy the webhook signing secret (the part after `whsec_`) and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_1234567890abcdef...
```

### Step 5: Restart Your Backend

After updating the `.env` file, restart your backend server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it
npm run dev
```

## Testing Payments

### Step 1: Add Items to Cart

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Browse products and add some items to your cart
3. Go to the cart page and click "Proceed to Checkout"

### Step 2: Use Test Card Numbers

Stripe provides test card numbers for different scenarios:

**Successful Payment:**

```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
```

**Declined Payment:**

```
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Expiry: Any future date
CVC: Any 3 digits
ZIP: Any 5 digits
```

### Step 3: Monitor the Webhook Events

In your Stripe CLI terminal, you should see webhook events like:

```
2024-01-15 10:30:45  --> checkout.session.completed [evt_123...]
2024-01-15 10:30:45  <-- [200] POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/webhook/stripe [evt_123...]
```

### Step 4: Check Your Application

- **Success Page**: After successful payment, you should be redirected to `/success`
- **Cancel Page**: If you cancel, you should be redirected to `/cancel`
- **Database**: Check that orders are created with status "paid"
- **Cart**: Your cart should be cleared after successful payment

## Production Setup

### Step 1: Get Live API Keys

1. Complete Stripe account activation
2. Switch to "Live mode" in your Stripe dashboard
3. Get your live API keys (starting with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)

### Step 2: Set Up Production Webhooks

1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers > Webhooks**
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set endpoint URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/webhook/stripe`
4. Select events to send: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret

### Step 3: Update Production Environment Variables

Update your production environment with:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_webhook_secret
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Problem**: Your webhook secret is incorrect or missing.
**Solution**:

- Make sure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in your `.env` file
- Restart your backend server after updating environment variables
- Verify the webhook secret from Stripe CLI output

#### 2. "No such checkout session"

**Problem**: The session ID in the URL doesn't exist.
**Solution**:

- Make sure your checkout session is created successfully
- Check server logs for checkout creation errors
- Verify your Stripe secret key is correct

#### 3. "Checkout session creation failed"

**Problem**: The backend can't create a Stripe checkout session.
**Solution**:

- Check that `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is correctly set
- Verify your Stripe account is active
- Check server logs for detailed error messages

#### 4. "Cart is empty after payment"

**Problem**: Cart isn't cleared after successful payment.
**Solution**:

- Check that webhooks are working properly
- Verify the webhook handler is processing `checkout.session.completed` events
- Check database for order status updates

#### 5. Frontend can't connect to Stripe

**Problem**: Stripe.js won't load or throws errors.
**Solution**:

- Verify `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set in `frontend/.env.local`
- Restart your frontend development server
- Check browser console for error messages

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test webhook delivery
stripe events resend evt_123...

# List recent events
stripe events list --limit 10

# Test your webhook endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/webhook/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

### Logs to Check

**Backend logs**: Look for:

- `‚úÖ Webhook signature verified successfully`
- `üéâ Payment processing completed successfully!`
- `‚ùå` symbols indicate errors

**Frontend console**: Look for:

- Stripe.js loading errors
- Network request failures
- Authentication issues
